	<center> <h3> <b> <mark> 2. LOMBA MENGETIK, BANDUNG, INDONESIA </h3> </b></mark> </center>

<p> The second thing that I experience after entering University was joining Lomba Mengetik or Speed Typing Test at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI), Bandung, Indonesia.  We went to there for 5 days and 4 nights.  We went to KLIA by bus from Uitm Machang.  After arriving at Soekarnoâ€“Hatta International Airport, we then rode bus to Bandung and it took 5 hours for us to arrive there because of traffic jammed. The next day, we went to the Universitas classroom for briefing for Lomba Mengetik Competition.  </p>
